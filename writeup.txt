Hey welcome to my writeup for my website for a restaurant in auckland

23/12/2023

I'm creating a index.html which would consist of the main logo and the main menu tool bars on the really top right all the time 

I added a picture of my dad and his friends in the main front picture, it would ahve my dad and the people that shopped in his takeaway
and it would have a top border that would have the menu

I'm gonna add like more pictures and it would have a slide show for the main picture


errors
theres alot of dishes in the restaurant therefore i would need to havea  dedicated page to food which would have
a  tool bar which would put it to what ever option there is to be like fried rice it would jump to fried rice

Been a little busy to do this but i added an about section right under the index.html

i'm planning to have everything on one page and it would make it move down as needed 

right now i need more pictureds of the shop for better presentation

errors:

need to make a menu asap
